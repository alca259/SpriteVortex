Obs: Unmaintained :) Kept here in hope of being of value for others and of course for myself :)

Description: SpriteSheet Cutter and Animator. Imports Spritesheet, detects frames, shows animations and exports animation definition file.

This project was my first real application coded in C# using WinForms and a DirectX Engine (Vortex2d (RIP)), so it only runs in Windows. Its most useful code is the spritesheet auto cutter, which scans the entire image pixel by pixel and tries to isolate its frames based on transparency around a non transparent area.
